# Capstone-Project
Develop a photorealistic, interactive MR app in Unreal Engine that runs on PC and streams to a headset.
Project Description
To develop a photorealistic, interactive mixed reality (MR) application using Unreal Engine, designed to run on a PC and stream to a Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2-based reference headset (Anorak). The project will showcase split rendering capabilities and explore the integration of generative AI (genAI) as a stretch goal for enhanced environmental interaction.


Scope & Deliverables:
Core Deliverable:
A student-designed MR application built in Unreal Engine, streamed from a Windows PC to the Anorak HMD using Qualcommâ€™s split rendering framework.

Stretch Goal:
Integration of genAI elements to enable dynamic interaction with the virtual environment.

Platform & Hardware:
Development Platform: X-Elite PC
Target Device: Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 reference headset (Anorak)
Framework: Qualcomm Split Rendering Pipeline
Required Skills:
Unreal Engine content development
Understanding of mixed reality concepts and workflows

Benefits For Students:
Hands-on experience with VR/MR development
Exposure to real-world content streaming for XR
Deep understanding of split rendering pipelines

Student Involvement:
Students will have creative freedom to define the content and interaction model of the MR experience, encouraging innovation and ownership while working within a structured technical framework.
